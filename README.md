# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Custom CNN

This project aims to classify **brain MRI images** into four categories:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

using a **Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset** (uploaded in folder).  
It contains MRI scans divided into four classes:

- `glioma_tumor/`
- `meningioma_tumor/`
- `pituitary_tumor/`
- `no_tumor/`

You can **download the dataset** from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NlEkHOOvoBK5eAHU84cLwpcVMHU27MfX?usp=sharing).

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The CNN architecture consists of:
- Convolutional + MaxPooling layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Dense layers for classification
